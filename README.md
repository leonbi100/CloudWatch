# CloudWatch

* CloudWatch is a website that notifies users of weather updates and suggests clothing to wear based on their current wardrobe.

> Inspiration: As a busy college student, I often found myself waking up late, putting on a random outfit, and rushing out the door. This often lead to me overdressing on hot days and then running out of options for other colder days (or vice versa). However, no matter how late I was, I would always glance at my phone. So I thought, what if my phone could quickly tell me what I should wear so I didn't have to spend time thinking about it?
